# Step 1 (10 points): Utilizing the DevRev API

In this task To interact with the DevRev API and create a work item, we utilize Java along with Maven for streamlined project management. Leveraging Maven's dependency management, we seamlessly integrate libraries like OkHttp or Apache HttpClient for HTTP communication with the DevRev API. Our Java code constructs an HTTP request, including the necessary headers and payload, and sends it to the designated API endpoint. Through proper testing and documentation, we ensure the reliability and functionality of our Java application, simplifying the process of creating work items within the DevRev platform.

# Step 2 (30 points): Creating a Snap-in For Priority assignment to newly created tickets.

In this task, I implemented the Priority Assignment to Newly Created Tickets using Java and Maven. The snap-in developed facilitates the automatic assignment of priorities to newly generated tickets based on their descriptions. Leveraging Java's OkHttp library and Maven's project management capabilities, the program sends HTTP requests to the DevRev API, extracting relevant information from the ticket descriptions to determine the appropriate priority level. This solution streamlines the ticket creation process, ensuring that each ticket is promptly assigned an appropriate priority, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the ticket management system
